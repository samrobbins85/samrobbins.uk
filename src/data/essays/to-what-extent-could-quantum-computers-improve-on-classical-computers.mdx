description: "This essay explores the potential of quantum computers to surpass classical computers by examining their physical principles, computational methods, and algorithmic advantages. Through detailed comparisons—including hardware structures, quantum gates, and key algorithms like Grover’s and Shor’s—it concludes that while quantum computing offers significant theoretical performance gains in fields like encryption and large-scale search, practical limitations in hardware and accessibility mean classical systems remain dominant for most real-world applications today."

## Introduction

Quantum computing is a key concept in computing, as it is a method which
allows for far faster computing, beyond the current limits of classical
computing. My question is: to what extent could quantum computers
improve on classical computers. I chose this topic because of its
relevance to the future of computing and the impact it can have on the
world. I am particularly interested in it due to my future plans to
study Computer Science at university and my interest in Physics.

I am going to explore this subject by finding out the key ways in which
quantum computers improve on classical computers, and compare the way a
quantum computer carries out a process compared to a classical computer.
After this I will compare the two methods, finding which is the best. I
will also compare the hardware of both quantum and classical computers,
comparing them and finding which scenarios each perform best in\
Quantum computers are computers that work on a superposition of states,
rather than the 1 and 0 as classical computers do. This allows for them
to process data much faster due to more efficient algorithms able to
utilise the larger number of states, alongside quantum properties such
as entanglement. I will be comparing these to classical computers, which
have been developed over a much longer time, allowing for the most
efficient algorithms on that hardware to be created, however these can’t
be developed much further due to the physical limitations of classical
computers.

## The Physics of Computers

### The physics of classical computers

#### Transistors

Classical computers work using transistors, these are in effect
electronic switches which will either permit or deny current through
them based on the current in the third leg.

![npn Transistor](https://res.cloudinary.com/samrobbins/image/upload/v1600791424/NPN_Transistor_awgvah.svg "NPN Transistor")

In this diagram the electrons are collected at the collector (C) and
then taken into the N doped silicon. When electrons are provided to the
base (B) they will flow into the P doped silicon. This will then cause
electrons to flow from the collector to the emitter (E), producing a
current.

#### Transistors and Logic Gates

Transistors can be arranged in many ways to produce logic gates. These
are then used in various combinations to perform the mathematical
operations that are used in classical algorithms.

![not Gate](https://res.cloudinary.com/samrobbins/image/upload/v1600791837/NOT_i3rxov.svg "NOT gate")

Above is shown the NOT gate, constructed from transistors, the input, X,
will be inverted to Y.

![AND Gate](https://res.cloudinary.com/samrobbins/image/upload/v1600791837/AND_i9hrmo.svg "AND Gate")

Above is the AND gate, this requires both X and Y to be on, in order for
Z to be on. This is because when X is on it will provide current for
Transistor 2, which will only transmit if Y is on.

![OR Gate](https://res.cloudinary.com/samrobbins/image/upload/v1600791837/OR_kyl0vd.svg "OR Gate")

Above is the OR gate, the collectors of the transistors are connected to
the + node, so that whenever the base (X or Y) receives an input, it
will give an output to the collector. The collector of both transistors
are connected to the output, so if one or both of them is on the output
will be on.

#### Moore’s Law

Moore’s law [^moore] states that: the transistor density of
integrated circuits doubles every two years. This has held true for many
years, however many argue that it will soon come to an end. The problem,
which is the main limitation of classical computers, is the size that
transistors can be made. Over many years the size has reduced, with
recent processors having transistors of length around 10nm from
collector to emitter. However, as the diameter of an atom is from 0.1 to
0.5nm, processor manufacturers will soon be unable to continue this
miniaturisation. This could lead to an end to development in classical
computers as if they can’t get any smaller they can’t get any faster.

[^moore]: Moore, G. 1998. Cramming more components onto integrated circuits. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(1), p.82–85.

### The Physics of quantum computers

#### Introduction to Qubits

Qubits are the quantum equivalent of binary bits, they can take a
combination of the ground state and the excited state. These states are
derived from the energy states of electrons around a nucleus in current
quantum computers, however in the future the nucleus could also be used.
The power of a quantum computer over a classical one is due to the fact
that it can take both of these simultaneously with different probability
amplitudes (the square root of the probability that when measured it
will be in that state).

#### Motion

Quantum computers work based on the spin of quantum particles[^iontrap].
These can be electrons but development is being made into using a
nucleus as the qubit in a quantum computer. These electrons are usually
held in a mechanism called an ion trap, this is where ions are kept in
one place, so that measurements can be made on them. These ions are kept
in one place by using high frequency voltage, this causes it to vibrate
in approximately one place. This motion is further reduced as the centre
of the defined range has very low motion, which the ion naturally tends
to as it is the state of least energy.

[^iontrap]: Steane, A. 1997. The ion trap quantum information processor. Applied Physics B: Lasers and Optics, 64(6), p.623–643.

#### Temperature

The next challenge is ensuring that the thermal energies[^energy] in the
processor are small compared to the energies in the operating of the
processor. The problem with this is that when operating the processor,
very low energies are used. This is because the kinetic energy gained
when an ion emits or absorbs a photon is in the order of between
$1\times10^{-18}J$ and $1\times10^{-20}J$. The thermal energy inside the
processor has to be less than this, requiring the temperature to be
extremely close to absolute zero. In order to do this, the ion trap uses
lasers. These cool the ions down as they provide energy in the direction
opposite to their momentum, reducing overall energy. One of the largest
problems in doing this is getting the correct frequency of light, this
is because the ions will only be affected by the energy from the laser,
if it is exactly the resonant frequency, this means that very precise
lasers are required to cool the ions. One of the problems is ensuring
that the lasers don’t add energy to the ions. This is solved by using
the Doppler Effect, this is where an object moving towards a wave will
experience it at a higher frequency. This is used in a quantum computer,
by providing light at a slightly lower frequency than required. This
means that ions moving towards it will experience the correct frequency,
reducing their energy, but those moving away will not gain any energy.

[^energy]: Steane, A. 2012. Introduction to Ion Trap Quantum Computing. University of Oxford - Department of physics.

#### Magnetic Field

All qubits have a spin, which is what is measured in a quantum computer.
The side effect of the spin is it creates a magnetic field. The problem
with this is that surrounding magnetic fields can change the spin. This
magnetic field created by the spin is so weak that it can be changed by
the earth’s magnetic field, the consequence of this is that a quantum
computer can’t work under normal magnetic conditions. To solve this the
quantum computer is electromagnetically shielded. This is done using
many superconducting magnetic fields, a side benefit of having to cool
the computer close to absolute zero. These counteract any incoming
magnetic fields, protecting the qubits in the processor.

#### Control

To change the state of a qubit, it is illuminated by a laser, adding or
reducing energy depending on direction relative to the movement of the
qubit, changing the energy and so the state. However, the power of a
quantum computer often comes from its ability to use two interacting
qubits. To do this an XOR gate is required. The quantum version of an
XOR gate is a CNOT gate, this flips qubit$_2$ if qubit$_1$ is equal to 1.

This works by exciting qubit$_1$ in a way that it will become excited
if its state is 1. The qubit is excited with too much energy, meaning
that it starts to excite all the qubits in the system if qubit$_1$’s
state was 1, meaning they require less energy to become excited.
Qubit$_2$ is then given less energy than if it was in a state unaffected
by qubit$_1$, this means that it will not become excited if qubit$_1$
wasn’t, but it will become excited if it was. To finalise the operation,
qubit$_1$ is given the same amount of energy as it was given originally,
cancelling out the excitation it gave to all the qubits, putting all but
qubit$_2$ back in their original state.

### Comparison

Quantum computers rely on much more volatile states than classical
computer do. This means that there is much more control required. The
consequence of this is that quantum computers are much harder to build
and manage, as well as them only being able to be used in one place.
This limits them compared to classical computers which are now small and
portable so can be used anywhere. As with the early classical computers,
it is likely that quantum technology will develop such that they can be
miniaturised, however that is not currently available. However, quantum
computers may not need to be portable as the current uses for them don’t
require them to be moveable.

The physics of quantum computers is beneficial, in that it allows for
the use of quantum algorithms. This can make the complexity in
construction and maintenance worthwhile, however only in certain
scenarios. It also could be argued that quantum computers are less
complicated than classical computers as quantum computers are only used
in certain cases, meaning that they only have a few thousand qubits,
compared to classical computers which have transistors in the order of
billions. This is partially due to the efficiency of quantum computing
as, for example a NOT gate requires 2 transistors but only 1 qubit.
Transistors are also of a larger size than qubits, meaning that more
qubits can theoretically be placed in a given area. Quantum computers
also have a larger potential for miniaturisation as they can be used
with electrons, which are smaller than $10^{-18}$m, meaning that the
limits of quantum computing are far smaller than the limits of quantum
computing. This means that theoretically on a 3cm$\times3$cm processor
there could me more than $9\times10^{32}$ qubits, far more than is
possible with a regular CPU, which has around $3\times10^{16}$
transistors (if each transistor was composed of 3 atoms, which is the
limit of what is possible without a scientific breakthrough). This means
that a quantum computer could have over a quadrillion times more
processing units than the best classical computers in a given chip size.

## Introduction to each method of operation

### Quantum Computers

#### Qubit Notations

The notation for qubits may appear similar to binary notation, however
the meaning of them is very different. For a single Qubit system, the
measurement will be in the format $\alpha\Ket{0}+\beta\Ket{1}$
[^alpha_beta]. Where $\Ket{0}$ is equal to
$\bigl[\begin{smallmatrix}1  \\\\0 \end{smallmatrix}\bigr]$ and $\Ket{1}$ is equal to
$\bigl[ \begin{smallmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \end{smallmatrix} \bigr]$. The probability of the Qubit being measured
as $\Ket{0}$ is $|\alpha|^2$ and the probability of the Qubit being
measured as $\Ket{1}$ is $|\beta|^2$. These probabilities must add to 1
as there is a 100$\%$ chance it will be in one of the two states, this
also means that the length of the vector
$\bigl[ \begin{smallmatrix} \alpha \\\\ \beta\end{smallmatrix} \bigr]$
is 1. This allows all quantum states to be
expressed as points on a unit circle. An example of this is shown in
figure 1, a representation of a vector in a Hilbert Space. This displays
the state $\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Ket{0}+\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Ket{1}$,
denoted as $\ket{+}$. This makes a $\dfrac{\pi}{4}$ angle with each axis
as the probability of each is equal.

![Superposition notation](https://res.cloudinary.com/samrobbins/image/upload/v1600785708/2020-09-22_15-41_1_spffjk.png "Superposition Notation")

When the probability of each state is different, for example, the state
$\dfrac{1}{2}\ket{0}+\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\ket{1}$. The angle with the
$\ket{0}$ axis is calculated by performing
$\arctan\bigg(\dfrac{\beta}{\alpha}\bigg)$ so, in this case, the angle
is $\arctan\bigg(\dfrac{\sqrt{3}\div2}{1\div2}\bigg)$ which is equal to
an angle of $\dfrac{\pi}{3}$.

The value of a Qubit can be measured with regards to $\ket{0}$ and
$\ket{1}$ as shown above, but it can also be measured in terms of
$\ket{+}$ and $\ket{-}$ where $\ket{+}$ is equal to
$\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{0}+\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{1}$ and $\ket{-}$ is
equal to $\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{0}-\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{1}$. This
is shown in Figure 2 which shows both the $\ket{0}\ket{1}$ and the
$\ket{+}\ket{-}$ basis. This allows the state $\ket{\psi}$ to be
measured in either of them. The sign and bit value cannot both be known
perfectly, this is because when measured, for example in the
$\ket{0}\ket{1}$ axis the superposition collapses and the value becomes
100$\%$ $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$. This means that if a second measurement
in the $\ket{+}\ket{-}$ basis was taken, the value would be different to
the result if that was the first measurement. As an example, from the
figure the state $\ket{\psi}$ is most likely to be measured as $\ket{0}$
as it makes the smallest angle with that axis. So when the value is then
measured in the $\ket{+}\ket{-}$ axis there is an equal probability of
either. However, if that had been measured first it would be most likely
to come as a $\ket{+}$ as it makes the smallest angle with that axis.

![Common Superpositions](https://res.cloudinary.com/samrobbins/image/upload/v1600785708/2020-09-22_15-41_2_dfrnej.png "Common Superpositions")

#### Quantum Gates

There are many quantum gates, some are very similar to classical gates
but some do functions that could not be performed on a classical
computer.

##### Pauli X Operator

One set of quantum gates are the Pauli Operators [^pauli], the Pauli X
operator is shown by the 2$\times$2 matrix:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}
$$

[^pauli]: Weisstein, E. 2002. Pauli Matrices. MathWorld–A Wolfram Web Resource.

This performs a similar function to the classical NOT gate and obeys the
following truth table

| Input     | Output     |
| --------- | ---------- |
| $\ket{0}$ | $\ket{1}$  |
| $\ket{1}$ | $\ket{0}$  |
| $\ket{+}$ | $\ket{+}$  |
| $\ket{-}$ | $-\ket{-}$ |

The reason for this can be shown in the below calculation:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\1&0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\0\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\1\end{bmatrix}
$$

##### Pauli Y Operator

The Pauli Y operator performs both a bit and phase flip and is shown by
the 2$\times$2 matrix

$$
\begin{bmatrix}0&-i\\\\i&0\end{bmatrix}
$$

The truth table of this gate is:

| Input     | Output      |
| --------- | ----------- |
| $\ket{0}$ | $i\ket{1}$  |
| $\ket{1}$ | $-i\ket{0}$ |
| $\ket{+}$ | $-i\ket{-}$ |
| $\ket{-}$ | $i\ket{+}$  |

The reason for this is explained in the following calculation:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}0&-i\\\\i&0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\0\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\i\end{bmatrix}=i\ket{1}
$$

#### Pauli Z Operator

The Pauli Z operator performs a phase flip, this in effect changes the
sign in front of the vector. It uses the following matrix.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\\\0&-1\end{bmatrix}
$$

This is very similar to the identity matrix and so will
not change the absolute value of any of the bits. However, it will
change the sign due to the negative sign on the bottom right hand value
of the matrix above.

| Input     | Output     |
| --------- | ---------- |
| $\ket{0}$ | $\ket{0}$  |
| $\ket{1}$ | $-\ket{1}$ |
| $\ket{+}$ | $\ket{-}$  |
| $\ket{-}$ | $\ket{+}$  |

This can be shown in the following calculation:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\\\0&-1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}  0\\\\1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}  0\\\\-1\end{bmatrix}
$$

##### The Hadamard Transform

The Hadamard transform creates an equal superposition of $\ket{0}$ and
$\ket{1}$. It does this using the matrix:
$$\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\\\  1&-1 \end{bmatrix}$$

This creates the truth table:

| Input     | Output    |
| --------- | --------- |
| $\ket{0}$ | $\ket{+}$ |
| $\ket{1}$ | $\ket{-}$ |
| $\ket{+}$ | $\ket{0}$ |
| $\ket{-}$ | $\ket{1}$ |

### How Classical Computers Work

#### Bit Notations

Binary bits have much simpler notations than Qubits as they take one
definite state, either a 1 or a 0. Larger strings of these can be used
to define larger states by each position taking values of powers of two,
with the smallest bit position being equal to $2^0$ which is equal to 1.
The next bit position will take $2^1$ which is equal to 2. Groups of
bits are used to show data, for example the byte (8 bits) can contain
$2^8=256$ different combinations, easily allowing for the Latin alphabet
and numbers along with many other alphabets.

#### Classical Gates

Computers construct logic gates from transistors this means that a CPU
made out of transistors can create combinations of these gates which can
be used to process data. The main logic gates are the AND, OR, NOT and
XOR, with extra gates with an integrated NOT gate like a NOR gate. The
only one bit gate is the NOT gate, this will invert the input, and
follows the following truth table:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 0     | 1      |
| 1     | 0      |

The AND gate will only turn on if both inputs are on, and so follows the
truth table in figure 4.

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0       | 0      |
| 0       | 1       | 0      |
| 1       | 0       | 0      |
| 1       | 1       | 1      |


The OR gate performs a similar function to the AND gate but will turn on
the inputs if either of the inputs are on, as shown in the truth table
in figure 5.

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0       | 0      |
| 0       | 1       | 1      |
| 1       | 0       | 1      |
| 1       | 1       | 1      |

The XOR gate is similar to the OR gate but will only turn on the output
if only one output is on, following the truth table in figure 6.

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0       | 0      |
| 0       | 1       | 1      |
| 1       | 0       | 1      |
| 1       | 1       | 0      |

### Comparison between the two methods of working

The method of quantum computing compared to classical computing could be
thought of as better due to its ability to take multiple states
simultaneously. This means that operations can be performed on long
strings of numbers represented in a superposition in one cycle. The same
in classical computers would require one cycle for each value in a list.

However, the benefit of classical computers is the relative simplicity
of the process, allowing for them to be more accessible. It also reduces
the research and manufacture time as they are well documented as
classical computers are much older inventions, with many experts in the
field.

## Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm

### How the Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm works

The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm [^deutsch] is used to find if a quantum
function is constant or balanced. A constant function will give one
result for any input. A balanced function will give one result for half
the inputs and another result for the other half.

The function will take
an input $x$ and give an output of $f(x)$. To start this algorithm two
qubits are needed, called $Q_1$ and $Q_2$. The Pauli x operator is
applied to $Q_2$ to turn it from $\ket{0}$ to $\ket{1}$. The Hadamard
transform is then applied to both Qubits, turning $Q_1$ into
${\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{0}}+{\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{1}}$ and $Q_2$
into ${\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{0}}-{\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{1}}$. These
Qubits are then given to the quantum function, and because $Q_2$ is
equal to $\ket{-}$ and $Q_1$v is equal to $\ket{+}$ the output from the
function to $Q_1$ is $(-1)^{f(x)}\ket{0}+(-1)^{f(x)}\ket{1}$. The
Hadamard transform is then applied again to $Q_1$, giving the result
$[(-1)^{f(0)}+(-1)^{f(1)}]\ket{0}+[(-1)^{f(0)}-(-1)^{f(1)}]\ket{1}$. If
the function is constant then f(0) = f(1) and because $(-1)^n+(-1)^n$
equals 2 if n is odd and -2 if n is even $\ket{1}$ will always have a
value if the function is constant. However $(-1)^n-(-1)^n$ always equals
zero and so $\ket{1}$ will not have a value. This means that if the
function is constant $Q_1$ will have a value of $\ket{0}$. However if
the function is balanced $f(0)\neq f(1)$ with a one bit binary output
only 1 and 0 are permitted. As $(-1)^0+(-1)^1$ equals zero but
$(-1)^1-(-1)^0=-2$ and $(-1)^0-(-1)^1=2$. This means that for a balanced
function $Q_1=\ket{1}$

[^deutsch]: Deutsch, D., and Jozsa, R. 1992. Rapid solution of problems by quantum computation. In Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences (pp. 553–558).

### A classical alternative to the Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm

The classical alternative to this algorithm would be to test the
function with a maximum of half the range of the input numbers. Most
times that range would not be necessary, as different output values
would often come up earlier. If the function gives all one value it is
constant but if two values are found it will be balanced.

### Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm compared to a classical method

The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm can be considered to be superior to a
classical algorithm, as it can find the correct solution with one query
of the function, whereas classically it could take up to $2^{n-1}$
queries where n is the length of the input strings. Obviously for large
number of bit inputs the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm has far greater
performance as it takes a constant number of queries, whereas
classically it requires an exponential number of queries. However, the
actual usefulness of either algorithm is severely limited as it can only
be performed on quantum functions, a task not often faced in the current
world.

## Searching Algorithms

### Binary Search

Binary search is a method used to find an item in an ordered list. It
works by choosing the middle element of a list and checking if the
desired item is before or after it and then discounting the other values
based on this result. As shown below, when trying to find the value C
with red being selections and strikeouts being removals.

|       |                                                  |                                     |                                                  |       |       |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----- | ----- |
| A     | B                                                | C                                   | D                                                | E     | F     |
| A     | B                                                | C                                   | <span class="text-red-500 line-through">D</span> | ~~E~~ | ~~F~~ |
| ~~A~~ | <span class="text-red-500 line-through">B</span> | C                                   | ~~D~~                                            | ~~E~~ | ~~F~~ |
| ~~A~~ | ~~B~~                                            | <span class="text-red-500">C</span> | ~~D~~                                            | ~~E~~ | ~~F~~ |

This will find the correct value in a maximum of
$\left \lfloor{log_2(N)+1}\right \rfloor$ comparisons with N being the
length of the list, as shown in the above example as it took
$\left \lfloor{log_2(6)+1}\right \rfloor =3$ steps to find the position.
Obviously this is worst case scenario and could only take 1 iteration if
the required element is in the middle.

### Grover’s Algorithm

Grover’s Algorithm [^grover] is an algorithm to find an object in an
unordered list. It works by performing a Hadamard transform on the
Qubit, turning it into multiple states with equal probability. For
example, for 3 bit strings it would produce the superposition listed
below:

[^grover]: Grover, L. 1996. A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search. In Proceedings of the twenty-eighth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing (pp. 212–219).

$$\dfrac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\Ket{000}+ \dfrac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\Ket{001}+ \dfrac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\Ket{010}+ \dfrac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\Ket{011}+ \dfrac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\Ket{100}+ \dfrac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\Ket{101}+ \dfrac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\Ket{110}+ \dfrac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\Ket{110}+ \dfrac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\Ket{111}$$

![Start of Grovers](https://res.cloudinary.com/samrobbins/image/upload/v1600788190/2020-09-22_16-22_mkeah3.png "Visualisation of the state at the start of Grover’s Algorithm
")

A function called the quantum oracle then looks at the state and turns
the probability amplitude of the desired section negative. It does this
through the process $\ket{x}\rightarrow(-1)^{f(x)}\ket{x}$ where f(x)=1
on the part of the superposition related to the desired element and
f(x)=0 otherwise. More precisely, this creates the superposition
$\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{x}\ket{f(x)}-\ket{x}\ket{1 \oplus f(x)})$ The
consequence of this is that a negative value will be returned when
f(x)=1 and a positive value will be returned when f(x)=0.

This process will inverse the probability amplitude of the desired
element, resulting in the state below attempting to search for
$\ket{101}$.

After this, the states are then increased based on their difference from
the mean and decreasing the amplitude if the difference is negative,
resulting in a higher probability for the desired element.

After one run this has a probability of the desired element being
measured of $\bigg(\dfrac{5}{4\sqrt{2}}\bigg)^2=\dfrac{25}{32}$, this
puts the answer at a 78$\%$ probability of being correct when measured.
In order to increase accuracy, this process is run
$\dfrac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{2^N}$ times where N is the string length. For this
example it would be $\dfrac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{2^3} = 2$ times. This would
mean that another loop of the inversion around zero, followed by the
transformation around the mean, would be required to improve it to a
suitable level of accuracy. This would then result in a probability
amplitude of $\dfrac{11}{8\sqrt{2}}$ for the correct element, giving a
probability of 95$\%$, a much better success rate making the algorithm
more reliable.

### Grover’s Algorithm compared to binary search

The main advantage of Grover’s Algorithm is that it can work on
unordered lists, meaning that unlike binary search the list does not
need sorting before an element can be found. The major advantage of this
is that it does not also require a sorting algorithm and so is a much
quicker option, meaning for larger databases it could be far superior.
For large databases the extra storage required to hold the sorted data
could mean that in binary search there would be a significant increase
in storage costs as their requirements would in effect double if the
data was not wanted to be stored in a sorted form. Another advantage of
this is that the order of the data is often very important, and so by
sorting it, the importance of the data is then lost.

The advantages of binary search are that it is a much quicker system to
implement and is currently used in many facilities. This is because
binary search can run on a classical computer, which is much cheaper
both to buy and run than the quantum computer needed for Grover’s
algorithm.

Another advantage of binary search is that it can be used on explicit
databases (databases spread over multiple storage areas)
[^practicalgrover] whereas Grover’s algorithm cannot. This means that it
is limited to a file stored in one place, vastly limiting its
capability, as most large databases (an area where Grover’s algorithm
would be useful) are spread over multiple servers.For example, the
millions of servers used by Google because it is impractical to store
all the information in one place due to its size. Storing all the data
in one place also reduces security and increases the impact of outages.

[^practicalgrover]: Viamontes, G., Markov, I., and Hayes, J. 2005. Is quantum search practical?. Computing in science & engineering, 7(3), p.62–70.

Binary search will also always give a correct answer, as opposed to the
90%-100% accuracy of Grover’s algorithm. This could be a large
problem for large firms as a 10% failure rate over millions of
searches would be unacceptable and so would mean that a classical
algorithm would be the only option.

## Factoring Algorithms

### RSA Encryption

The main use of factoring numbers is in encryption, this is because many
encryption systems work on the factors of large numbers, I will explore
this with the example of RSA. RSA encryption works by multiplying two
large prime numbers together, this creates the number, n. This n is then
used to encrypt a message using the form $E=m^emod(n)$ where e is an
encrypting value. This is then decrypted using $m=E^dmod(n)$. A value
denoted as $\phi(n)$ is a value based on the factors of n found by
$(p-1)\times(q-1)$ where p and q are the factors. This value of
$\phi(n)$ is then used to find e as it is any number less than n that is
not a factor. The value of d is then found using
$\dfrac{k\times\phi(n)+1}{e}$ where k is the first integer that makes d
an integer value.\
RSA can be broken by finding the prime factors of n. This then allows
for $\phi(n)$ to be found, allowing for d to be found, as shown above.
Then with the message,E,the decrypting value, d, and n the message can
be decrypted.

### Quadratic Sieve

The quadratic sieve [^sieve] is a classical algorithm used to factor
numbers, it is performed by expressing the number to be factorised as
the difference of two squares. Starting at $\sqrt{N}$ and increasing the
value of x until $x^2-N=y^2$ as below in factorisation of 989

[^sieve]: Pomerance, C. 2008. Smooth numbers and the quadratic sieve. Algorithmic Number Theory, Cambridge, MSRI publication, 44, p.69–82.

| x   | $y^2$ | y     |
| --- | ----- | ----- |
| 32  | 35    | 5.916 |
| 33  | 100   | 10    |

Obviously, not all iterations of this will be as quick but this shows
that $33^2-10^2$ is equal to 989, the factors can then be found from
33+10=43 and 33-10=23. However, this will not work for all numbers.
Factors can also be computed from values $(y_1)^2$ and $(y_2)^2$ that
are not square numbers but multiply together to give a square number and
the corresponding $x_1$ and $x_2$. With A being $x_1 \times x_2$ and B
being $\sqrt{y_1^2 \times y_2^2}$ The GCD of (A+B, N) and (A-B, N) are
factors.

### Shor’s algorithm

Shor’s algorithm [^shor] is a quantum algorithm which also factorises
numbers, however it performs it through a different method to the
quadratic sieve. The first task is to find the period of $x^a mod n$
where x is any number, 2 in my example. A is then increased from 0. n is
the number to be factored. This will then create a list of numbers when
performed and the period is found where the pattern repeats itself. In
my example I tried to factor 989, as also shown in the quadratic sieve
section. This results in a period of 154. Another number is then
calculated by dividing the period over 2, called z in the formula then
doing $y=a^z mod n$, working to being $y=2^{77} mod989$ which results in
y=300. From this number the GCD of (y+1,n) and (y-1,n) is calculated,
these are easily calculated with Euclid’s algorithm, a classical
algorithm, demonstrated below, trying to calculate GCD(301,989) and
GCD(299,989). For example for 301 and 989:

[^shor]: Shor, P. 1999. Polynomial-time algorithms for prime factorization and discrete logarithms on a quantum computer. SIAM review, 41(2), p.303–332.

$$989=301\times3+86$$
$$301=86\times3+43$$
$$86=43\times2+0$$

When the number is added, the greatest common divisor will be the number
at the end above, in this example 43. Doing this again for the other two
numbers gives 23, these two numbers are the prime factors of 989. This
is how it is performed classically, however when trying to find the
period of large numbers takes too much time. Shor’s algorithm takes the
number to be factored (N), and a random number (A) which is not a factor
of N (GCD(N,A)=1). Another number, n, is chosen which dictates the size
of the register, the larger this is the greater the time taken but the
greater the accuracy. For this example N will be 39, A will be 7 and n
will be 10. q is $2^n$ so in this case it is $2^{10}$.

The algorithm is started in the state $\ket{0}\ket{0}$, the QFT (Quantum
Fourier Transform) is then applied to the first Qubit, changing it to
the state:

$$\ket{\psi}=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{q}}\sum\limits_{x=0}^{q-1}\ket{x}\ket{0}$$

So with the numbers used in the example it is

$$\ket{\psi}=\dfrac{1}{2^5}\sum\limits_{x=0}^{{2^{10}}-1}\ket{x}\ket{0}$$

Now $f(x)$ is calculated and put in the second register, in Shor’s
algorithm $f(x)$ is $a^x mod n$. This then creates the state

$$\ket{\psi}=\dfrac{1}{2^5}\sum\limits_{x=0}^{{2^{10}}-1}\ket{x}\ket{f(x)}$$

The second qubit is then measured, this causes it to collapse to one
state, meaning that the state will only include instances where f(x)=y,
with y being the measured value. This now makes it easier to find the
period, as the difference between values in the state is the period. The
inverse QFT is then applied to this state.

This transformation then leads to a distribution of values with some
having higher probability than others. The most likely values, divided
by q, will approximately give a fraction, whose numerator is the period.
For the numbers given above a likely value is 85. This is then divided
by $2^{10}$ to give a fraction. This fraction is then converted, by
continued fractions, into a number with a numerator of 1. This will give
$\dfrac{1}{12}$, giving the period of 12.

This period is then used in the formula $a^{r/2}modN$ which is
$7^6mod39=25$ the GCD of (25-1,37) and (25+1,39) are then found which
are 3 and 13, which are the prime factors of 39.

### Shor’s algorithm compared to Quadratic Sieve

For the example of factoring a larger number, for example 792347. Shor’s
algorithm runs in $(2logN)(loglogN)(logloglogN)$ time. This means that it will run in 68
time units. However, the quadratic sieve runs in
$e^{\sqrt{\ln(n)\ln(n)\ln(n)}}$ time which would mean it would run in
$5.4\times10^{21}$ time units. This difference is because quadratic
sieve runs in exponential time, whereas Shor’s algorithm runs in log
time, meaning that as the number gets larger the difference in speed for
Shor’s will be less than the difference for the quadratic sieve.
Factoring becomes interesting regarding cryptography, this is because
one of the most popular encryption methods is RSA. The current largest
RSA number is RSA-2048, this is 2048 bits, equal to 617 digits. Using
general number field sieve, the fastest algorithm for strings over 100
digits long, the time taken would be $4.8\times10^{34}$ units. This is
much longer than the run time for Shor’s algorithm for that number,
which would be 40884 time units. The potential of Shor’s algorithm could
mean that current cryptography systems will be obsolete as the security
of RSA comes from the fact that the numbers can’t be factored. Supposing
that the time units were seconds, the classical algorithm would take
longer than the life of the universe as it would take $1.5\times10^{27}$
years and the life of the universe is $1.1\times10^{17}$ years.
Comparing this to the run time of Shor’s algorithm which is 11 hours, it
is easy to see the danger that Shor’s algorithm poses to existing
encryption.

## Conclusion

In conclusion the physics of quantum computers allow for superior
computation to classical computers, but they come with the trade-off of
increased manufacturing costs, increased power consumption and increased
space requirements compared to a classical computer

Due to the increased popularity and reduced complexity of classical
computers compared to quantum computers, how they work is much more
widely known. This allows for far more people to be able to work on
them, making it a better choice for companies to use them.

Quantum algorithms allow for data to be processed much faster than
classical algorithms, however there is currently only a few available
algorithms, meaning the utility of quantum computing is not yet fully
realised. Quantum algorithms also are only superior to classical
algorithms when processing large values, meaning that they wouldn’t
provide any noticeable benefit to domestic consumers and may even
perform worse than classical computers, whose main use is lots of short
processes.

Currently quantum computers are only experimental, but some large
companies, such as NASA, have bought a quantum computer in order to see
what practical uses they can offer. However, companies such as Google
may soon be able to find a practical use for them, for example,
improving the speed of their search results, meaning they would be able
to reduce the number of traditional servers, saving both power and
space.

Without any breakthrough development in cooling technology, or a way to
operate a quantum computer at room temperature, it is unlikely that
quantum computers will be used directly by consumers in the foreseeable
future. Instead they will be used as a replacement for supercomputers
due to their reduced space and power requirements for the same
performance. Therefore the only interaction consumers will have with
quantum computers will be over the internet. This is because they have
the power to increase the speed and accuracy of image recognition,
search speed and may also revolutionise the encryption industry.

I believe I have achieved what I have set out to achieve as I explored
the utility of quantum computers and their limitations. I think overall
quantum computers could be better than supercomputers but it is unlikely
they will be used, widely in the consumer market without further
advances in technology.

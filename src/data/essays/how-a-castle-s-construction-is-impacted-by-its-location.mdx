title: "How a castle's construction is impacted by its location"
date: 2021-05-17
description: "This project investigates how the construction and features of English castles were influenced by their geographic location, using natural language processing to extract architectural traits from official heritage records and mapping them across NUTS1 regions. The analysis reveals strong correlations between castle features—such as building materials, basements, tunnels, and stables—and regional geology, historical threats, and local craftsmanship, highlighting both the physical and socio-political factors that shaped medieval fortifications."

# Introduction

The task I have chosen is to model the features of Castles in England by
geographic location. While there were prehistoric hillforts and Roman
forts in England prior to this, the main period of castle building in
England started after the Battle of Hastings in 1066
[^richardhodges1988oote]. A popular design of these was the Motte and
Bailey castle, with the castle on a raised area of ground (the motte),
and a range of supporting buildings protected by a wall (the bailey).
The materials used here changed from wood to stone as time went on,
which provided much better defence. As the design of the keep was
refined, the development then moved onto the outer defences, improving
the gatehouses and enclosure walls.

Towards the end of the middle ages, the defence aspect of Castles became
less important, and they started to be used as shows of status, with
more space, and increasing the size of windows, which reduced the
defence, but gave better views.

While I have discussed here the studied aspect of how design has changed
with time, there is less information about how design changes with area.
Design might change due to the differing requirements of the area, along
with differences in geology and geography. As discussed, castles are
continually improved, with new designs based on the times, however some
castles may have not kept up with these improvements due to the wealth
of the owners, or because the castles are left behind.

# Sources of data and used modules

The main source of data will be the National Heritage List for England,
published by Historic England [^nhle]. Data will be obtained from this
using Beautiful Soup, a web scraping tool for Python [^bs]. The data
will then be processed by Stanza, a Natural Language Processing Python
library [^qi2020stanza]. Data is then visualized using plotly in order
to make the patterns clearer to see [^plotly]. The mapping makes use of
a map of the UK from the Office of National statistics [^ons].

# Models and implementation

The analysis of text uses multiple of the features from Stanza, first in
using Part of Speech Tagging in order to find nouns and plural nouns in
the sentences, as these are most likely to be the features I am looking
for.

I am also using the provided lemmas feature in order to just extract the
singular versions of the nouns, so that if in some cases a feature is
discussed in plural, and in some cases singular, they will be treated
the same. This has both benefits and drawbacks, providing a benefit in
increasing the matching, however the use of the plural may convey
information about the features, such as if a castle has multiple towers,
compared to one tower.

The dependencies provided are also used to match together compound
nouns, such as "curtain wall", as this provides more information than
the separate nouns "curtain" and "wall".

In order to categorize the castles into sections, I am using NUTS1
regions of England [^nuts], this is an EU specification which divides up
countries, in this case, dividing England into 9 regions. There is the
option to get more granular with NUTS2 and NUTS3 regions being smaller
than NUTS1, however given the limited dataset of around 230 castles, I
wanted to ensure there were many castles per region so that the trends
would be visible.

The location of each castle is extracted from the webpage, using an
Ordnance Survey Grid Reference. This is then turned into latitude and
longitude coordinates, which is finally converted into a NUTS region.
One area in which this caused some trouble is in castles on small
islands, as the converter must have been using a map that excluded these
for performance. However the only case in which I discovered this was
Lindisfarne castle, so not a significant proportion of the data, and so
shouldn't affect the trends seen.

In order to simplify the categorization process, first I ran the code to
generate an ordered list of features by how many times they occur. This
list was then filtered to just the top 50 that I wanted to observe. This
was done to ensure they were significant findings, as if it was just
from one castle, it doesn't imply any trend. For these 50 features, a
dictionary was created under each NUTS1 region with each features, and
as the program went through the castles, the number was incremented if
the feature was found in that region. Also kept track of was the total
number of castles in each region so that the number of features could be
divided by the number of castles to get an average value, ensuring that
regions that just had more castles didn't look like they had more of a
certain feature.

# Evaluation of models

On evaluating the heatmaps, features did come out as showing as more
prominent from certain areas, they can be shown below. You will see that
London is white on this map as none of the castles in the dataset were
in the London area.

The simplest evaluation of these results is to look at the description
of building materials. Due to the difficulty of transportation at the
time castles were being built, they use materials from the local area,
and so they reflect geological surveys.

The most obvious of these are sandstone, limestone and flint, as shown
below

Data from the British Geological Survey shows a large flint deposit in
the south east area where flint is featured so heavily [^bgs]. Sandstone
covers the west of England, curving round to the North East, with the
rest featuring limestone instead. This map can be viewed on the [BGS website](https://mapapps.bgs.ac.uk/geologyofbritain/home.html)

In addition to these two natural resources, the derivatives of natural
resources can also be seen, with the South West using a lot more brick
than other areas. These observations are supported by the observations
found by Hislop that brick castles are restricted to the east and south
east. [^hislopmalcolm2016cb:a].

![London Clay](https://www.datocms-assets.com/39153/1626514371-geologicalmapoflondonbasin.jpg "London clay formation")

This is likely due to the large amount of Clay in the Thames valley,
named the London Clay Formation [^sumbler1996london]. This can be seen above.

Geology can also have an impact on the features the castles have, along
with what they're made of. Tunnels are used in castles for seige
warfare, however they have also been used for connecting sections of
castles, such as the Castle of La Roche-Guyoon [^hislopmalcolm2016cb:a],
where tunnels were made through the chalk. Due to the lack of machines,
the ease of digging the rock the castle was built on was important for
this, and this can be seen with east anglia, which has a large amount of
chalk bedrock, being more common for building tunnels.

One of the features most distinctly confined to one area is the use of a
Basement. This trend started with Norham Castle near the Scottish border
[^hislopmalcolm2016cb:a] and remained in the North. This is true for a
few features, the reason behind which is hypothesized to be the
influence of the Palatinate of Durham [^hislopmalcolm2016cb:a] as
they employed master builders and master masons who worked on many of
the castles in the area, and so used similar techniques.

Near the Scottish border, castles had to defend against Border Reivers, who's main
activity was stealing animals from land around the Scottish border [^moffat2011reivers].
It can be seen that in Northern areas, stables are more important parts of the castles,
allowing to protect horses from the Reivers.

# Conclusion

The results found could be compared with other factors in order to
explain the reasons for the patterns shown. The strongest of these are
the materials used for the castles as those building the castles had no
choice but to use local materials, whereas specific features may change
over time or for the specific challenges a castle faces. However, other
features can also be observed having differences based on area for a
variety of reasons, including the masons that worked on the castles and
the requirements the castle has.

One limitation of this work is that it is done based on the descriptions
provided in the listings, which didn't follow any specific structure.
This means that features may just be neglected to be mentioned in the
description for certain castles. Another limitation is the size of the
dataset, with around 230 castles, the sample size isn't big enough to
draw definite conclusions about areas.

Future work in this area could benefit from consultation with historians
in each area as there isn't much research in how the design of castles
depend on their location.
